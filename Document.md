# Blood Donation Management System 
## Problem Statement

Blood banks, hospitals, and patients frequently struggle with the timely availability and efficient distribution of safe blood. 
Traditional systems rely on manual donor records, paperwork, and phone-based coordination, leading to delayed responses during emergencies,
lack of real-time inventory visibility, and missed opportunities for repeat donations. Donors are often not engaged proactively,
resulting in limited retention and low participation during crises. Hospitals face challenges in identifying suitable blood types
quickly or connecting with donors and nearby blood banks, which can put patient lives at risk. There is a critical need for a centralized,
intelligent blood donation management solution that enables real-time tracking of inventory, automates donor engagement, manages urgent requests,
and streamlines collaboration between donors, blood banks, and hospitals—ensuring faster, safer, and more reliable blood availability for all.

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
### 1. Requirement Gathering
Identified key needs for blood banks, hospitals, and donors: donor registration, donation history tracking, blood inventory management, urgent hospital requests, and automated donor engagement.

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis
Donors: Individuals willing to donate blood

Blood Bank Staff: Manage donor information, inventory, and coordinate donations

Hospital Staff: Request blood during emergencies and routine cases

Administrators: Oversee compliance, quality, and inventory levels

Volunteers/NGOs: Assist organizing donor drives and awareness

### 3. Business Process Mapping
Current State: Manual donor tracking, telephonic requests, and paper inventory cause delays and shortages

Proposed Flow:
  Donor registration → Eligibility verification → Scheduled donation
  
  Donation completion → Inventory update
  
  Hospital request → Automated matching → Donor/stock allocation

Automated donor reminders and feedback collection

### 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Challenges in Healthcare: Ensuring safe and timely blood availability, rapid response to emergencies, maintaining compliant donor history, and minimizing wastage due to expiry

Relevant Use Case: Real-time inventory tracking and urgent donor mobilization help address seasonal shortages and disaster scenarios

### 5. AppExchange Exploration
Explored existing Salesforce healthcare and donor management apps; found most lack custom blood inventory, real-time emergency matching, and integrated donor engagement for repeat donations—validating need for a dedicated, extensible solution
