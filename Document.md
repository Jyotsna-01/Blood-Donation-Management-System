# Blood Donation Management System 
## Problem Statement

Blood banks, hospitals, and patients frequently struggle with the timely availability and efficient distribution of safe blood. 
Traditional systems rely on manual donor records, paperwork, and phone-based coordination, leading to delayed responses during emergencies,
lack of real-time inventory visibility, and missed opportunities for repeat donations. Donors are often not engaged proactively,
resulting in limited retention and low participation during crises. Hospitals face challenges in identifying suitable blood types
quickly or connecting with donors and nearby blood banks, which can put patient lives at risk. There is a critical need for a centralized,
intelligent blood donation management solution that enables real-time tracking of inventory, automates donor engagement, manages urgent requests,
and streamlines collaboration between donors, blood banks, and hospitalsâ€”ensuring faster, safer, and more reliable blood availability for all.
